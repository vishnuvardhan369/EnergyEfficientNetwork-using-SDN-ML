#  Energy-Efficient IoT Network (Optimized RPL Routing)

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the energy efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) networks by optimizing the routing process. It focuses on the use of RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks), a protocol designed for low-power devices, and explores how integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles and Machine Learning (ML) can further improve routing decisions.

## Background

- **RPL Protocol:**  
  RPL is commonly used in IoT networks where devices have limited power. It organizes the network into a tree structure (known as a DODAG) where each node selects a "best parent" to forward data upward to a central gateway. Although effective for low-power communication, traditional RPL may not always choose the most energy-efficient path.

- **Machine Learning Integration:**  
  By collecting data on energy consumption, latency, and packet delivery from simulated network scenarios, ML models can be trained to predict and select the most energy-efficient routing paths. This adaptive approach aims to extend the network lifetime and improve overall performance.

## Project Objectives

- **Optimize Energy Consumption:**  
  Reduce the energy used by IoT nodes through smarter routing strategies.

- **Improve Network Performance:**  
  Enhance packet delivery rates, reduce latency, and increase network reliability.

- **Dynamic and Adaptive Routing:**  
  Utilize ML to analyze simulation data and predict optimal routing paths under varying network conditions.

## Project Approach

- **Simulation Environment:**  
  The project uses the Contiki Cooja simulator to model IoT networks running the RPL protocol. Simulations are performed under various conditions to collect key performance metrics.

- **Data Collection:**  
  Metrics such as energy consumption, latency, and hop count are logged during simulations. This data forms the basis for training ML models to predict energy-efficient routes.

- **Future Integration of SDN:**  
  Although the current focus is on RPL and simulation data, future work will explore integrating an SDN controller. This would enable centralized, dynamic routing decisions, further enhancing energy efficiency.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Extended Device Lifespan:**  
  By optimizing routing, the project aims to prolong battery life in IoT devices.

- **Enhanced Network Reliability:**  
  Improved routing decisions will lead to higher packet delivery ratios and lower latency.

- **Scalable Framework:**  
  The approach provides a framework that can be expanded with SDN and advanced ML techniques for broader IoT applications in smart cities, industrial monitoring, and healthcare.
